For the provided list of statements, determine whether each statement is relevant to address the input.
Please generate a list of JSON with two keys: `verdict` and `reason`.
The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either a 'yes', 'idk' or 'no'. Answer 'yes' if the statement is relevant and/or informative to addressing the original input, 'no' if the statement is irrelevant or does not relate, and 'idk' if it is ambiguous (eg., not directly relevant but could be used as a supporting point to address the input).
The 'reason' is the reason for the verdict.
Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'. 
The provided statements are statements made in the actual output.

Since you are going to generate a verdict for each statement, the number of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to the number of `statements`.

Example:
User input:
Question:
What should I do if there is an earthquake?
Statements:
- "Shoes."
- "Thanks for asking the question!"
- "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
- "Duck and hide"

Expected output:
{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The 'Shoes.' statement made in the actual output is completely irrelevant to the input, which asks about what to do in the event of an earthquake."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk"
        },
        {
            "verdict": "idk"
        },
        {
            "verdict": "yes"
        }
    ]  
}
