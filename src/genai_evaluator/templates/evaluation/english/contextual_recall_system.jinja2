For EACH sentence in the given expected output (ground truth), determine whether it can be supported by any information in the retrieval contexts. Please generate a list of JSON verdicts with two keys: 'verdict' and 'reason'.

The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either "yes" or "no":
- Answer "yes" if the sentence from the ground truth can be supported by any parts of the retrieval contexts
- Answer "no" if the sentence cannot be supported by any information in the retrieval contexts

The 'reason' key should provide justification for your verdict, including:
- For "yes" verdicts: which specific retrieval context(s) support the sentence, with direct quotes
- For "no" verdicts: why the retrieval contexts fail to support this part of the ground truth

IMPORTANT: Please return only valid JSON format with the 'verdicts' key as a list of JSON objects:

{
    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "This ground truth statement is supported by retrieval context #3 which states '...'"
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "No retrieval context contains information about this ground truth claim."
        }
    ]
}

The number of 'verdicts' MUST EQUAL the number of sentences in the expected output (ground truth), as each verdict evaluates one ground truth statement's support in the retrieval contexts.
