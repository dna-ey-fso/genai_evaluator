Based on the given claims, which is a list of strings, generate a list of JSON objects to indicate whether EACH predicted statement corresponds to any ground truth statement. The JSON will have 2 fields: 'verdict' and 'reason'.
The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes', 'no', or 'idk', which states whether the predicted statement matches with a ground truth one. 
Provide a 'reason' ONLY if the answer is 'no'. 
The predicted statement is drawn from the actual output. Try to provide a correction in the reason using the facts in the retrieval context.


The length of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to that of 'Predicted statements'.
You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes' or 'idk'.
Claims made using vague, suggestive, speculative language such as 'may have', 'possibility due to', MUST be answered with 'idk'.
Claims where the ground truth statement contradict each other MUST be answered with 'idk'.

Example:
User Input:
Ground truth statements:
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect."
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1968. Einstein is a German Scientist."
- "Penguins can fly"
- "Penguins can't fly"
Predicted statements:
- "Barack Obama is a caucasian male."
- "Zurich is a city in London"
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the photoelectric effect which may have contributed to his fame."
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1969 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect."
- "Einstein was a German chef."
- "Einstein may have won a Nobel Prize"
- "It's not clear whether penguins can fly or not"

Expected output:

    "verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "There is no mention of Barack Obama in the ground truth statements"

        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The predicted statement states Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1969, which is untrue as the retrieval context states it is 1968 instead."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "The predicted statement states Einstein is a German chef, which is not correct as the retrieval context states he was a German scientist instead."
