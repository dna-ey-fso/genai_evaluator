Given the input, expected output, and retrieval context, please generate a list of JSON objects to determine whether each string in the retrieval context list was remotely useful in arriving at the expected output.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the 'verdicts' key as a list of JSON. These JSON only contain the 'verdict' key that outputs only 'yes' or 'no', and a 'reason' key to justify the verdict. In your reason, you should aim to quote parts of the context.

Example Retrieval Context:

    "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect"

    "He won the Nobel Prize in 1968."

    "There was a cat."

Example Input: "Who won the Nobel Prize in 1968 and for what?"
Example Expected Output: "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1968 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect."

Example:
{
"verdicts": [
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "It clearly addresses the question by stating that 'Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect.'"
        },
        {
            "verdict": "yes",
            "reason": "The text verifies that the prize was indeed won in 1968."
        },
        {
            "verdict": "no",
            "reason": "'There was a cat.' is not at all relevant to the topic of winning a Nobel Prize."
        }
    ]
}

Since you are going to generate a verdict for each context, the number of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL TO {{ document_count_str }}
