Based on the given claims, which is a list of strings, generate a comprehensive list of JSON objects to indicate whether each claim contradicts any claims in the retrieval context. The JSON will have 2 fields:

- The 'verdict' key should STRICTLY be either 'yes', 'no', or 'idk'.
- The 'reason' key should be a string describing why the answer is 'no'.

Provide a 'reason' ONLY IF the answer is 'no'. Try to provide a correction rather than the given claim agrees with the context.

The provided context may have contradictory claims, in which case the claims should be answered 'idk' to avoid contradictions in your reasoning.

Example:

Ground truth context:
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect."
- "Barack Obama is a caucasian male."
- "Zurich is a city in London"
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1969 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect which may have contributed to his fame."
- "Einstein was a German chef."

User claims:
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1968. Einstein is a German Scientist."
- "Zurich Obama is a caucasian male."
- "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1969 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect which may have contributed to his fame."
- "Einstein was a German chef."

Expected output:
{
  "verdicts": [
    {
      "verdict": "idk"
    },
    {
      "verdict": "idk"
    },
    {
      "verdict": "yes"
    },
    {
      "verdict": "no",
      "reason": "The actual output claims Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1969, which is untrue as the retrieval context states it was 1968 instead."
    },
    {
      "verdict": "no",
      "reason": "The actual output claims Einstein is a German chef, which is not correct as the retrieval context states he was a German scientist instead."
    }
  ]
}

The length of 'verdicts' SHOULD BE STRICTLY EQUAL to that of claims.
You DON'T have to provide a reason if the answer is 'yes' or 'idk'.
ONLY PROVIDE a 'no' answer if the retrieval context DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS the claims. YOU SHOULD NEVER USE YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR JUDGEMENT.
ONLY provide a 'no' answer if the retrieval context such as 'may have', 'possibility to', do NOT count as a contradiction.
Claims made using vague, suggestive, speculative language/are not mentioned in the retrieval contexts MUST be answered 'idk'.
Claims that are not backed up due to a lack of information MUST be answered 'idk'.
